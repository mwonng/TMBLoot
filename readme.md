**NOTE**: only works on WoW BCC, and this addon currently under my guild wide test, probably not suitable for you, but if you have a try, please let me know any issue. sorry for the convenience.

2. paste form export in [thatsmybis](https://thatsmybis.com/) (choose 'Loot Received, Wishlists, Prios, and Notes')
