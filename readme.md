# Thatsmybis Loot

This is a WoW classic plugin for [That's my bis](https://thatsmybis.com/).

This plugin can announce the prio and wishlist when looting after you import from [thatsmybis](https://thatsmybis.com/)

**NOTE**: only works on WoW BCC, and this addon currently under my guild wide test, probably not suitable for you, but if you have a try, please let me know any issue. sorry for the convenience.

## How to setup:

1. enter game use `/tl show` or `/tmbloot show`
2. paste form export in [thatsmybis](https://thatsmybis.com/) (choose 'TMB Tooltips Addon - View CSV')
3. click 'save' button
4. done

The announcement will only send when you looting.

If you looking for SR and TMB both and this addon also has the same feature with TMBLoot, even better performance than mine.
